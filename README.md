# NewEarnings
Code for my article on improved earnings measures to deal with aggregation bias in Standard-Poor 500 Index. Data is taken from Siblis Research. We take quarterly net incomes for each of the 500 companies for each quarter 1979Q1-2019Q1. Instead of summing them, we sum only positive ones. This helps overcome aggregation bias, when negative earnings of some companies cancel positive earnings of other companies. Then we compute earnings yield based on this, and regress future equity premium based on that. We find correct time step (5 quarters) to make sure the residuals are i.i.d. normal (based on QQ plots and normality tests). We apply Bayesian framework with Jeffrey's non-informative two-dimensional prior. We evaluate the conventional wisdom that future returns are lilely to be lower than long-term historical averages, since the current market is overpriced. 
ModifiedEarnings.xlsx contains all data, including aggregated data on net incomes from Siblis Research. We cannot publish original data because it is proprietary. IncomesOrig.py contains Python code.
